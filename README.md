Power-Genre-Analysis-Simulator (WIP)

A simple program where users build teams based on elemental affinities, analyze win probabilities, and battle using randomized outcomes. Starting small but will expand with advanced mechanics over time :9.
Overview

Elemental Battle Simulator is a simple and fun program where you:

    Build a team of three characters with elemental affinities (Fire, Water, Air, Earth).
    Analyze your chances of winning against an opponent team.
    Engage in battles with outcomes based on calculated probabilities.

This project starts with basic mechanics and will expand to include fusions, advanced strategies, and more features over time.
How to Play

    Choose Your Team: Pick three characters with predefined elements or fusions.
    Select Opponent Team: Choose or randomly generate an opposing team.
    Analyse Probabilities: The program calculates your win chances based on element matchups:
        Fire > Air
        Air > Earth
        Earth > Water
        Water > Fire
        Fusion types add unique modifiers.
    Battle: The result is decided by a randomiser weighted by the win probability.
